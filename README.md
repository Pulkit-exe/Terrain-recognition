## Introduction

Terrain recognition is an essential task in various fields such as autonomous driving, environmental monitoring, and robotics. This project aims to provide a pre-trained model capable of accurately identifying different types of terrain from images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training this model is available on Kaggle and consists of images categorized into four terrain classes: rocky, sandy, marshy, and grassy. It has been divided into three parts:

- **Training Set**: This set contains images used for training the model. These images are used to adjust the model's parameters through backpropagation.
- **Validation Set**: This set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model and evaluate its performance during training. It helps prevent overfitting.
- **Testing Set**: This set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. It contains unseen data that the model has not been exposed to during training.

The dataset was carefully curated to ensure a diverse representation of different terrains and to maintain an appropriate balance between the classes.

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yourusername/terrain-dataset).

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on ResNet-50, a popular deep convolutional neural network architecture known for its excellent performance on image classification tasks. The pre-trained ResNet-50 model was fine-tuned on the terrain dataset to optimize its performance for terrain recognition.

## Usage

To use the terrain recognition model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terrain-recognition.git
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Use the model to predict the terrain type of an input:
     ```bash
    from terrain_recognition import predict_terrain
    image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
    terrain_type = predict_terrain(image_path)
    print("Predicted Terrain Type:", terrain_type)
